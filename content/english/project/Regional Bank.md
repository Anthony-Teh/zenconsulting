The organisation is one of New Zealand’s leading and longstanding banking institutions. They have maintained their NZ identity and ownership despite facing huge disruption in the financial services industry over recent years. The bank established a strategic programme to re-imagine a tailored and personalised experience for their customers.

### The Challenge
The challenge is to retain their uniquely community centric identity and to wrap around it a digitally enabled customer experience. In an age where consumers expect service anytime, anywhere, the organisation wanted to offer their broad ranging customer community a tailored and personalised customer experience. They engaged Rowan Teh to help establish a Process Governance function within their organisation. This involved conducting a Time and Motion assessment, creating a customer-facing process library, conducting Lean process improvement events, as well as adopting a co-creation, collaborative approach to build capability within the bank.

### Key Outcomes
Rowan's engagement helped them achieve the following outcomes:
1. Identified and removed non-customer facing processes from customer facing teams – through application of time and motion principles, identified, validated and applied tangible measures
2. Generated significant process improvement opportunities processes through application of Lean value stream analysis
3. Created a Process Library framework of customer facing processes, aligned existing processes, mapped processes identified through the branch observation exercise and applied an industry standard framework.

### Our Difference
Rowan provided key differentiators to traditional consulting approaches:
1. Structured approach leveraging best practice Lean value stream analysis and mapping
2. Highly engaging workshops with foundational Lean training to prepare stakeholders
3. Deep experience with examples from other organisations to provide insights
4. Data gathering templates and accelerators to automate Lean analysis
5. Strong focus on stakeholder alignment to ensure change journey towards improvement implementation
6. Simple, but comprehensive reporting and documentation suitable for executive as well as teams.

### Conclusion
Rowan facilitated an approach that successfully generated improvement ideas based on measurable benefits to focus on the customer. This provided the bank with a strong case for change to create a better customer experience in processes.
