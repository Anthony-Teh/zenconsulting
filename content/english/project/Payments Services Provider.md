The organisation, a payments services and solutions provider, needed to implement a global Digital Strategy/Roadmap, Target Operating Model (TOM) and derive a future-state Enterprise Architecture for key product platforms.  

### The Challenge
1. Contined growth through acquisitions globally has placed strain on internal IT governance, support and systems
2. Subsidiaries varies significantly in their maturity of IT support processes and systems
3. Limited view of future IT investments for managing their internal IT support to promote scalability and innovation
4. Leveraging public cloud hosting options to minimise internal infrastructure overhead
5. Seeking to consolidate and rationalise the number of platforms across subsidiaries to create more synergies and remove duplication.

### Key Outcomes
Rowan Teh's engagement helped them achieve the following outcomes:
1. Developed and implemented industry standard IT policies and procedures to complement their global Digital strategy and TOM
2. Established Infrastructure and Network Centers of Excellence by defining standards, internal IT processes and a future roadmap
3. Programme managed the assessment and migration of a subsidiary’s hosting to public cloud
4. Assessed the current-state of platforms across subsidiaries and derived a future-state business architecture and solution design that rationalised the number of platforms.

### Our Difference
Rowan provided key differentiators to traditional consulting approaches:
1. Applied a consultative approach to engaging stakeholders globally
2. Strong knowledge and experience of IT best practices to apply to Centre’s of Excellence
3. Templated all approaches to be repeatable with more acquisitions
4. Built consensus on value and vision to identify quick wins.

### Conclusion
Rowan facilitated an approach that successfully fulfilled the requirements of this organisation in a structured and pragmatic manner.
