Pan Pac Forest Products Ltd provides sustainable and tailored forest products to domestic and international markets. Owned by Oji Group, a leader in the pulp and paper industry in Japan, Pan Pac has been growing, processing and delivering radiata products for over 50 years. In 2022, Pan Pac embarked on a company-wide digital transformation comprising of an ERP system implementation. This transformation provided Pan Pac with significant benefits such as simplification/standardisation/consistency of business processes, one source for key information and foundation for innovation with new technologies. However, there was equally significant risk to the business.

### The Challenge
The digital transformation posed significant risk to Pan Pac’s business in terms of the impact to stakeholders and processes. Pan Pac needed a trusted advisor with experience of delivering similar scale and complexity projects to help mitigate the risks. We were engaged to provide project governance and quality assurance over the project.

### Key Outcomes
Through our engagement, Pan Pac was able to achieve the following outcomes:
1. Early alignment among stakeholders of the transformation’s vision and objectives across all business areas
2. Completeness and accuracy of deliverables to quality standards and acceptance criteria
3. Definition of user acceptance criteria consistent with original transformation objectives
4. Independent voice in steering committee meetings to hold Pan Pac and vendors accountable
5. Redesign of the IT function to support the ERP system in a BAU-state.

>*"Rowan has always given balanced, and considered advice based on his wide experience in ERP Implementations. His ability to give good governance and risk advice has been a vital cog in the Project’s success. Also his ability to help with practical and pragmatic advice for BAU has been much appreciated.”* 
>**Ross McMillan (Chief Financial Officer, Pan Pac).**

### Our Difference
We provided key differentiators to traditional project governance support:
1. A pragmatic approach to project governance that operated at a project management-level as well as helped mitigate risks by deep-diving into project delivery to uplift capability
2. Specialised in delivering ERP system implementations and large-scale change programmes
3. Ability to communicate and address concerns of stakeholders at an executive down to team member-levels
4. Knowledgeable of ERP support functions, roles and responsibilities.

### Conclusion
Every project has unique circumstances that can present risks. Whilst our approach to project governance leverages industry best practices in project controls, we tailor the areas of focus depending on the need. We also support the team to fill gaps where there are capability and capacity challenges.
