The organisation specialises in regional infrastructure: ports, electricity distribution and transmission networks, and electricity generation. Efficient management and accurate reporting on the full lifecycle of assets are essential, especially as they have interested parties such as the community and significant regulatory compliance commitments across their sectors.

### The Challenge
Their asset management processes and data involve different departments using different systems. Over time, these processes and data have been impacted by incremental changes to organisational roles, procedures and systems. More recently, they implemented a new ERP system, which introduced new processes and a single source of data for assets. 

### Key Outcomes
Rowan Teh helped the organisation achieve the following:
1. Streamlining the end-to-end Asset Lifecycle Management
2. Identifying and prioritising process and system improvements 
3. Distinguishing roles and responsibilities between departments across processes
4. Identifying key system sources (ERP and GIS) that captures financial and maintenance-related asset data.

### Our Difference
Rowan enabled the organisation to:
1. Adopt a Lean approach for achieving value to the business throughout the end-to-end asset lifecycle
2. Focus on essential information required on assets at each stage; from the asset plan through to disposal
3. Consider variations in processes based on different asset classes
4. Seamlessly map business and system architecture of the asset lifecycle 
5. Quickly capture a consolidated view of the asset lifecycle stages, information and data, processes, systems and roles.

### Conclusion
Rowan simply offered a uniquely different approach to understand and designing the end-to-end asset lifecycle enabled by an ERP system. Rowan provided an asset lifefycle process structure template to align their processes with an industry standard taxonomy. This provided them with a guiding structure for capturing the asset lifecycle processes. By following this structure, they could be easily translated into system requirements that many solutions align to.
