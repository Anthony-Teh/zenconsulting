The organisation is a New Zealand fully integrated orchard-to-service business delivering premium produce to leading retailers and wholesalers. Since its establishment in early 80's, they have grown to become New Zealand and Australia’s largest fruit grower as well as maintaining a reputation of being experts in supply chain management, comprising of orchard, harvest and post-harvest processes.

### The Challenge
The rapid growth of this organisation's business, from producing a wide range of products to more markets, resulted in tremendous strain in internal processes and systems. This organisation recognised that their processes needed to be streamlined and systems modernised for scalability. They also saw an opportunity to adopt practices from the industry, especially in finance and operations. Whilst there are many finance and operations solutions in the market, they wanted to ensure they understood their pain points and opportunities with best practices.

### Key Outcomes
Rowan Teh was engaged to generate a significant number of detailed requirements that addressed key inefficiencies in their current processes and systems. These requirements allowed them to:
1. Understand their end-to-end business architecture across finance and operations
2. Build a common taxonomy of business processes based on industry standards using the APQC Process Classification Framework (PCF)®
3. Uncover key areas of inefficiencies (bottlenecks and manual/duplicate effort) by value stream and process
4. List specific outputs, workflow, integration, data objects and system functionality embedded in processes
5. Create a future-state reporting architecture based on data elements across existing reports
6. Produce a requirements list easily translated into system features for a market scan of solutions
7. Create a current-state blueprint as input to the solution design.

### Our Difference
Rowan was chosen as he offered unique services to provide process excellence that:
1. Adopted industry-standard processes and taxonomy useful in the selection of new systems
2. Automated the capturing and value stream analysis of processes saving time and cost
3. Surfaced key areas of inefficiencies to generate improvements based on process data
4. Enabled an online mechanism for capturing and sharing process information with stakeholders onsite and offsite
5. Proven methodology supported by deep knowledge and experience of processes and systems.

### Conclusion
Rowan offered a uniquely different and data-driven way of understanding business requirements and generating an ideal state for new systems. Rowan provided a process structure template using APQC's Process Classification Framework® to align processes with an industry-standard taxonomy. This provided them with a guiding structure for capturing current-state processes as well as potentially value-adding processes universally accepted as industry standards. By following this structure, they could be easily translated into system requirements that many solutions align to.
