The organisation was launched and funded by the NZ government and philanthropy to provide independent connection and advocacy services for young people in care. Since launching they had an aggressive target to open multiple branches around NZ.

### The Challenge
To achieve their mission, they needed a Digital Strategy that enabled a strong digital connection between children and young people advocacy practitioners, community support, other trusted adults, and the government.

### Key Outcomes
Rowan Teh's engagement helped them achieve the following outcomes:
1. A Lean Digital Strategy framework guided by an overarching mission statement and strategic pillars around their collaboration platforms, information management, branch operations and reporting and analytics
2. Each one of these pillars has a number of initiatives to implement, which form their roadmap to create a long-term, scalable and practical digital footprint that can be easily replicated across all branches.

### Our Difference
Rowan provided key differentiators to traditional consulting approaches:
1. An approach that comprehensively covers digitisation opportunities across all areas of an organisation, from its value proposition and customer journey, through to service/product innovation and core foundation (internal operations)
2. Conducted industry research to provided insights of what other digital opportunities were being embraced in the same sector.

### Conclusion
Rowan facilitated an approach that successfully generated a Lean digital strategy and roadmap specific to the requirements of this organisation.
